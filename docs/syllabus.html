<p>My walk-in help hours start week 2. Note that you can bring a fellow
student with you when you sign-up for a session. Just click the âAdd
Guestsâ link when you sign-up, and add in your fellow studentâs UP
email. If you need more than 15 minutes, you can book at least two
consecutive sessions.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-learning-commons" class="section level3">
<h3>The Learning Commons</h3>
<p>Students can get academic assistance through Learning Commons
tutoring services and workshops. The Co-Pilot peer tutoring program
provides students with opportunities to work with other students to get
help in writing, math, group projects, and other courses. Schedule an
appointment to meet with a Co-Pilot (tutor) by visiting the <a
href="www.up.edu/learningcommons" target="_blank">Learning Commons</a>
website. Students can also meet with a Co-Pilot during drop-in hours.
Check the Learning Commons website or drop by the Learning Commons in BC
163 to learn more about their services. Find a tutor at the Learning
Commons to get support on your academic journey.</p>
</div>
<div id="math-resource-center" class="section level3">
<h3>Math Resource Center</h3>
<p>Appointment-based tutoring accepts appointments starting week 1 and
sessions start week 2. Visit the <a
href="https://www.up.edu/learningcommons/math-resource-center/index.html"
target="_blank">Math Resource Center</a> website to sign-up for an
appointment. Drop-in tutoring is Monday to Thursday, 3:00 PM - 7:00 PM
in BC 163 and starts week 2. Check the Math Resource Center website or
drop by the center for more information.</p>
</div>
<div id="help-hours-guidelines" class="section level3">
<h3>Help Hours Guidelines</h3>
<p>It is strongly recommended that you attend the walk-in help hours or
set up a one-to-one meeting with the me if you feel like you are falling
behind during our in-person class activities, or if you just need to
clarify concepts discussed in class. In order to be more productive
during a one-to-one meeting (or the walk-in help hours), these are three
recommendations before you come in:</p>
<ul>
<li>List all gaps in knowledge you have (missed concepts) or list all
concepts that were unclear to you during class. We will address them one
by one.</li>
<li>Prepare questions you want answered and be ready to show relevant
materials.</li>
<li>Regarding assignments, prepare to show (a) what are the steps you
have tried and (b) what are the errors you encountered and the
strategies you have tried.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that these are recommendations so that you can get the most out
of the help hours allocated for you. If you just want to come in and
chat about something else, feel free to do so. If the dedicated time for
one-to-one meeting does not work for you, send me a message to set up an
appointment.</p>
</div>
<div id="collaboration-policy" class="section level3">
<h3>Collaboration Policy</h3>
<p>I expect you to participate in the class through lectures,
discussion, labs, and other engagements. I also expect you to make use
of opportunities to get help outside of class (help hours, Teams, email,
tutoring) if you need help. Concise and specific messages are the most
helpful so I know how I can best help you.</p>
<p>Students are encouraged to participate in discussions with their
peers (or each other) regarding homework and other assignments. However,
each student must take responsibility and ownership of their work and
submit their work individually.</p>

<h3>Standards-Based Grading</h3>
<p>Learning mathematics takes hard work, thinking what you have learned,
and making changes to your understanding. Students will be assessed on
their proficiency in mathematics, and they will have opportunities to
demonstrate their proficiency, revise their work and reflect on their
learning.</p>
<p>This course follows the standards-based grading system which focuses
on the mastery of specific learning standards. It is more accurate and
motivating than traditional grading systems, and can help to create a
more equitable learning environment. Here are some of the key features
of this type of grading:</p>
<ul>
<li>Focuses on mastery of specific learning standards</li>
<li>Uses a variety of assessment methods</li>
<li>Provides feedback to students on their progress</li>
<li>Helps students to set goals and track their progress</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="grading" class="section level3">
<h3>Grading</h3>
<p>Each assignment will be graded according to the general grading guide
detailed below. Each student will be given feedback on their assignment
and learning process to improve their performance. Note that each
assignment has its own rubric guided by these general guidelines and the
assignmentâs learning objectives.</p>

<h3>Submission Guidelines</h3>
<p>You can submit your assignments physically or online through
Gradescope. If you decide to submit online, your work can be
hand-written or typed, but must be uploaded as a single pdf file. If you
had handwritten your answers/solutions on a physical paper, make sure to
label it properly and please scan your document using a scanner app for
clarity. Suggestions: âAdobe Scanâ for Android or iOS.</p>
</div>
<div id="worksheets" class="section level3">
<h3>Worksheets</h3>
<p>There will be worksheets for each non-project week. The purpose of
the worksheets is for in-class group work and activities. The group
members must submit their completed worksheet individually by
end-of-class or end-of-day. Worksheets are graded mostly on completion,
and partially on correctness. Your name must exist in your worksheet and
the names of your collaborators.</p>
</div>
<div id="homeworks" class="section level3">
<h3>Homeworks</h3>
<p>Homework is assigned every week and due every Friday by end-of-day,
except for project weeks. You must do and submit your homework
individually. Homework is graded mostly on correctness and
completion.</p>
</div>
<div id="homework-revisions" class="section level3">
<h3>Homework Revisions</h3>
<p>You can revise your homework for an up-grade, meaning - for example -
a grade of âNIâ can be up-graded to âAâ.</p>
<p>Here are the qualifications and requirements for homework
revisions:</p>
<ul>
<li>A homework grade of âNMIâ, âNIâ, âAâ, or âEâ.</li>
<li>You must submit homework on time.</li>
<li>The homework to be revised must be completed, meaning all parts
should have your full written solutions. Incomplete homework is
disqualified for revisions, but you can still use them as practice.</li>
<li>A complete written revisions of the parts with errors in your
homework.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are the rules for homework revisions:</p>

</ul>
</div>
<div id="project" class="section level3">
<h3>Project</h3>
<p>This course is focused on applying linear algebra concepts to science
or engineering fields, such as data analysis, probability and
statistics, and machine learning. Thus, the course requires you to
complete a semester-long project that is specific and guided.</p>
<p>The project is an individual <em>expository analysis</em> that
demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of the theory of linear
algebra and how it applies in the practice of your chosen science or
engineering field. An expository analysis project typically involves
exploring and presenting a topic related to the application of linear
algebra concepts in real-world scenarios.</p>
<p>Every semester is unique and topics can very each semester. See the
Project section in the class website for more details on the project
topics.</p>
<p>The general timeline of the project is done in four phases:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Phase 1:</em> Topic Selection, literature Review, and
theoretical framework.</li>
<li><em>Phase 2:</em> Application, computational aspect, results, and
analysis.</li>
<li><em>Phase 3:</em> Visualizations, discussions, and conclusions.</li>
<li><em>Phase 4:</em> Final report and presentation to the whole
class.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each phase has its own specific tasks of the same chosen topic, and
due date on when these tasks should be done. You must submit a written
report by the time you present, and present that report to me in each
phase. The one-to-one presentation allows you to demonstrate your
understanding of your project verbally and receive valuable feedback. It
is administered mostly in dialog style. The presentation is only ten to
fifteen minutes.</p>
<p>As a student in this course, the table below outlines the criteria
used to assess the abilities demonstrated in each phase. The final
report and presentation will be evaluated comprehensively.</p>

<h2><strong>Expectations</strong></h2>
<div id="cancelation-policy" class="section level3">
<h3>Cancelation Policy</h3>
<p>You can cancel your appointments, but it is strongly recommended that
you cancel 12 hours before your scheduled time so that other students
can schedule when a spot opens. You can reschedule for a different day
and time if you need to.</p>
<p>Please try to show-up to any of your appointments. If you have
extenuating circumstances, please let me know as soon as possible to
discuss next steps.</p>
</div>
<div id="attendance-and-participation" class="section level3">
<h3>Attendance and Participation</h3>
<p>Attendance is not tracked. However, participation is highly
recommended. You are expected to actively participate in this class.
Participation includes coming to class on time, being prepared, being
willing to ask questions and share ideas, setting up study groups
outside of class, attending tutoring sessions, posting helpful resources
online, and contributing to the Teams discussion channels. Group and
individual presentations of ideas is a suggested component of
participation.</p>
</div>
<div id="absences" class="section level3">
<h3>Absences</h3>
<p>Generally, students are expected to attend all class sessions
according to the instructorâs direction. Students who feel unwell should
NOT attend class in person. These students should inform their
instructor as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Should the instructor need to miss class, the course may be
temporarily conducted remotely. Should the instructor be unable to teach
for an extended period of time, the respective department or unit will
find a substitute to continue the course.</p>
</div>
<div id="late-assignments-and-incompletes" class="section level3">
<h3>Late Assignments and Incompletes</h3>
<p>You are expected to turn in all completed assignments on time.
Circumstances that may disallow you to turn in your work on time - such
as a medical reason - are understandable. Please let me know if you are
unable to submit your work and have missed the deadline way beyond its
original posted date. Because every assignment is an important aspect of
your learning in this class, we will discuss when you will turn in the
assignment as well as decide upon an acceptable consequence for your
turning it in late. I am committed to successfully helping you learn
from this course.</p>
</div>
<div id="diversity-equity-and-inclusion-statement"
class="section level3">
<h3>Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Statement</h3>
<p>In the study of natural and mathematical sciences, often perceived as
objective disciplines aimed at understanding the world, it is crucial to
recognize the historical biases embedded within these fields, stemming
from a limited set of privileged populations. Acknowledging the
potential existence of overt and covert biases within the course, I
emphasize that science is a human endeavor necessitating the
incorporation of diverse experiences in the pursuit of knowledge and
skill. Valuing every student irrespective of background, origin, race,
religion, ethnicity, sexual orientation, disability status, etc., I am
committed to fostering an inclusive climate throughout the course.
Encouraging open communication about concerns or challenges, I assure
confidentiality, except for instances of academic integrity violations
or sexual harassment, which are legally mandated to be reported. Within
our classroom, diversity and individual differences are celebrated as
strengths, and the use of mathematics as an analytical tool to challenge
power, privilege, and oppression is supported. It is our collective
responsibility to create a welcoming space where ideas can be challenged
while maintaining respect for individuals.</p>
</div>
<div id="accessibility-statement" class="section level3">
<h3>Accessibility Statement</h3>
<p>The University of Portland strives to make its courses and services
fully accessible to all students. Students are encouraged to discuss
with their instructors what might be most helpful in enabling them to
meet the learning goals of the course. Students who experience a
disability are also encouraged to use the services of the Office for
Accessible Education Services (AES), located in the Shepard Academic
Resource Center (503-943-8985). If you have an AES Accommodation Plan,
you should meet with your instructor to discuss how to implement your
plan in this class. Requests for alternate location for exams and/or
extended exam time should, where possible, be made two weeks in advance
of an exam, and must be made at least one week in advance of an exam.
Also, if applicable, you should meet with your instructor to discuss
emergency medical information or how best to ensure your safe evacuation
from the building in case of fire or other emergency. All information
that students provide regarding disability or accommodation is
confidential. All students are responsible for completing the required
coursework and are held to the same evaluation standards specified in
the course syllabus.</p>
</div>
<div id="code-of-academic-integrity" class="section level3">
<h3>Code of Academic Integrity</h3>
<p>The University of Portland is a diverse academic community of
learners and scholars who are dedicated to freely sharing ideas and
engaging in respectful discussion of those ideas to discover truth. Such
pursuits require each person, whether student or faculty, to present
truthfully our own ideas and give credit to others for the ideas that
they generate. Thus, cheating on exams, copying another studentâs
assignment, including homework, or using the work of others without
proper citation are some examples of violating academic integrity.</p>
<p>Especially for written and oral assignments, students have an ethical
responsibility to properly cite the authors of any books, articles, or
other sources that they use. Students should expect to submit
assignments to Turnitin, a database that ensures assignments are
original work of the student submitting. Each discipline has guidelines
for how to give appropriate credit, and instructors will communicate the
specific guidelines for their discipline.</p>
<p>The use of artificial intelligence (AI) tools such as ChatGPT without
attribution also constitutes plagiarism. Students must cite any
AI-generated text and ideas and disclose any activities
(e.g.Â brainstorming, editing, translating, etc.) for which AI was
employed. Students are expected to demonstrate sound judgment in
discerning when and how to utilize AI ethically across their academic
work, upholding standards of citation, originality, and integrity. The
misuse of AI to shortcut academic requirements will be considered a
breach of academic integrity. Students who have questions about when and
how to use AI should talk with their instructor.</p>
</div>
<div id="referencing-and-citation-guidelines" class="section level3">
<h3>Referencing and Citation Guidelines</h3>
<p>In your written work for this course, you must cite all sources of
information that you use, whether they are direct quotes, paraphrases,
or summaries. The style of citation that you use should be consistent
throughout your paper. The citation styles for this course are APA or
CSE.</p>
<ul>
<li>APA style is used in the social sciences and psychology. It is
characterized by parenthetical citations that include the authorâs last
name and the year of publication. For example, âAccording to Smith
(2023), the average height of a man in the United States is 5â10â.â</li>
<li>CSE style is used in the natural sciences and engineering. It is
characterized by numbered citations that are listed at the end of the
paper. For example, â[1] Smith, J. (2023). The average height of a man
in the United States. Journal of Human Biology, 55(2), 123-132.â</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are unsure which citation style to use, please consult with
me. You can also find more information about APA and CSE style in the
Clark Library citation guidelines: <a
href="https://libguides.up.edu/cite"
target="_blank">libguides.up.edu/cite</a></p>
<p>Plagiarism is the act of using someone elseâs work without giving
them credit. It is a serious academic offense that can result in a
failing grade or even expulsion from school. By following these
guidelines, you can help to avoid plagiarism and ensure that your work
is properly cited.</p>
</div>
<div id="mental-health-statement" class="section level3">
<h3>Mental Health Statement</h3>
<p>Anyone may sometimes experience problems with their mental health
that interfere with academic experiences and negatively impact daily
life. If you or someone you know experiences mental health challenges at
UP, please contact the University of Portland Wellness Center in the
lower level of Orrico Hall (down the hill from Franz Hall and near
Mehling Hall) at 503-943-7134 or <a href="mailto:wellness@up.edu"
class="email">wellness@up.edu</a>. Their services are free and
confidential. In addition, confidential phone counseling is available at
the Pilot Helpline by calling 503-943-7134 and pressing 3. The
University of Portland Campus Safety Department (503-943-4444) also has
personnel trained to respond sensitively to mental health emergencies at
all hours. Remember that getting help is a smart and courageous thing to
do - for yourself, for those you care about, and for those who care
about you.</p>
</div>
<div id="non-violence-statement" class="section level3">
<h3>Non-Violence Statement</h3>
<p>The University of Portland is committed to fostering a safe and
respectful community free from all forms of violence. Violence of any
kind, and in particular acts of power-based personal violence, are
inconsistent with our mission. Together, all UP community members must
take a stand against violence. Learn more about what interpersonal
violence looks like, campus and community resources, UPâs prevention
strategy, and what we as individuals can do to assist on the Green Dot

<div id="ethics-of-information" class="section level3">
<h3>Ethics of Information</h3>
<p>The University of Portland is a community dedicated to the
investigation and discovery of processes for thinking ethically and
encouraging the development of ethical reasoning in the formation of the
whole person. Using information ethically, as an element in open and
honest scholarly endeavors, involves moral reasoning to determine the
right way to access, create, distribute, and employ information,
including: considerations of intellectual property rights, fair use,
information bias, censorship, and privacy. More information can be found
